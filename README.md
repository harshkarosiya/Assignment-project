# Next.js Landing Page Assignment

## Overview
This project is a Next.js landing page where I replicated designs and interactive features from multiple websites. It includes:

- Hero section with interactive diagonal lines that follow the cursor.
- Pop-up contact form that appears 3 seconds after page load.
- Slider section for images.
- Background Video: Full-screen video background with transparent play button. Clicking anywhere on the video toggles play/pause. Play button scales on hover and disappears when video is playing.
- Footer section with Blogs & News (frontend only, no backend).
- SEO-friendly tags applied throughout the project.

## Challenges and Approach
- **Cursor Animation:** The moving diagonal lines that follow the cursor were the most time-consuming part. I used AI assistance (ChatGPT) to help implement smooth transitions and delayed movement.
- **Pop-up Contact Form:** Implemented a timed popup using `setTimeout`. AI guidance helped with clean React and Tailwind implementation.
- **SEO Optimization:** To ensure proper on-page SEO, including headings, alt tags, and semantic structure, I used AI to review and refactor the code without changing any content.
- **Frontend Layout:** Making the hero section and cursor animation work together correctly and ensuring other content like sliders and hero text overlaps properly.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling everything with Tailwind, including responsive layouts, spacing, and hover effects.

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies and run the development server:
